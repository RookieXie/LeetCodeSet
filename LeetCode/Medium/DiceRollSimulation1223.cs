    /*
     A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number i more than rollMax[i] (1-indexed) consecutive times. 

Given an array of integers rollMax and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact n rolls.

Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
